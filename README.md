Cleaned data by checking for missing values and duplicates

Detected and treated outliers using Interquartile Range (IQR) method

Performed univariate analysis with mean, median, trimmed mean, range, variance, and standard deviation calculations for numerical columns

Conducted frequency counts and mode identification for categorical columns

Visualized distributions using histograms, KDE plots, boxplots, and bar charts

Explored bivariate relationships through scatter plots and grouped boxplots

Created correlation matrix heatmap focusing on numerical variables

Summarized insights and findings from the analysis
